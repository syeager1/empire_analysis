NOTES PREFACE 1. On the declining sovereignty of nation-states and the transformation of sovereignty in the contemporary global system see Saskia Sassen Losing Control? Sovereignty in an Age of Globalization (New York: Columbia University Press 1996). 2. On the concept of Empire see Maurice Duverger Le concept dempire in Maurice Duverger ed. Le concept dempire (Paris: PUF 1980) pp. 523. Duverger divides the historical examples into two primary models with the Roman Empire on one side and the Chinese Arab Mesoamerican and other Empires on the other. Our analyses pertain primarily to the Roman side because this is the model that has animated the Euro-American tradition that has led to the contemporary world order. 3. Modernity is not a phenomenon of Europe as an independent system but of Europe as center. Enrique Dussel Beyond Eurocentrism: The World System and the Limits of Modernity in Fredric Jameson and Masao Miyoshi eds. The Cultures of Globalization (Durham: Duke University Press 1998) pp. 331; quotation p. 4. 4. Two interdisciplinary texts served as models for us throughout the writing of this book: Marxs Capital and Deleuze and Guattaris A Thousand Plateaus. 5. Ours is certainly not the only work that prepares the terrain for the analysis and critique of Empire. Although they do not use the term Empire we see the work of numerous authors oriented in this direction; they include Fredric Jameson David Harvey Arjun Appadurai Gayatri Spivak Edward Said Giovanni Arrighi and Arif Dirlik to name only some of the best known. 1.1 WORLD ORDER 1. Already in 1974 Franz Schurmann highlighted the tendency toward a global order in The Logic of World Power: An Inquiry into the Origins Currents and Contradictions of World Politics (New York: Pantheon 1974). 416 NOT E S T O P AGES 4  7 2. On the permutations of European pacts for international peace see Leo Gross The Peace of Westphalia 16481948 American Journal of International Law 42 no. 1 (1948) 2041. 3. Danilo Zolo Cosmopolis: Prospects for World Government trans. David McKie (Cambridge: Polity Press 1997) is the one who expresses most clearly the hypothesis that the paradigm of the project of the new world order should be located back in the Peace of Vienna. We follow his analysis in many respects. See also Richard Falk The Interplay of Westphalia and Charter Conception of International Legal Order in C. A. Blach and Richard Falk eds. The Future of International Legal Order (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1969) 1:3270. 4. Hans Kelsen Das Problem des Souveranitat und die Theorie des Volkerrechts: Beitrag zu einer Reinen Rechtslehre (Tubingen: Mohr 1920) p. 205. See also Principles of International Law (New York: Rinehart 1952) p. 586. 5. Kelsen Das Problem des Souveranitat p. 319. 6. See Hans Kelsen The Law of the United Nations (New York: Praeger 1950). 7. On the legal history of the United Nations see Alf Ross United Nations: Peace and Progress (Totowa N.J.: Bedminster Press 1966); Benedetto Conforti The Law and Practice of the United Nations (Boston: Kluwer Law International 1996); Richard Falk Samuel S. Kim and Saul H. Mendlovitz eds. The United Nations and a Just World Order (Boulder: Westview Press 1991). 8. On the concept of domestic analogy both from the genealogical point of view and from that of international juridical politics see Hedley Bull The Anarchical Society (London: Macmillan 1977); and above all Hidemi Suganami The Domestic Analogy and World Order Proposals (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1989). For a critical and realistic perspective against conceptions of a domestic analogy see James N. Rosenau Turbulence in World Politics: A Theory of Change and Continuity (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1990). 9. See Norberto Bobbio Il problema della guerra e le vie della pace (Bologna: Il Mulino 1984). 10. For Norberto Bobbios position on these arguments see primarily Il terzo assente (Turin: Edizioni Sonda 1989). In general however on recent lines of internationalist thought and on the alternative between statist and cosmopolitan approaches see Zolo Cosmopolis. 11. See the work of Richard Falk primarily A Study of Future Worlds (New York: Free Press 1975); The Promise of World Order (Philadelphia: Temple University Press 1987); and Explorations at the Edge of Time (Philadelphia: NOT E S T O P AGES 8  1 3 417 Temple University Press 1992). The origin of Falks discourse and its idealist reformist line might well be traced back to the famous initial propositions posed by Grenville Clark and Louis B. Sohn World Peace through World Law (Cambridge Mass.: Harvard University Press 1958). 12. In Section 2.4 we will discuss briefly the work of authors who challenge the traditional field of international relations from a postmodernist perspective. 13. Capitalism was from the beginning an affair of the world-economy . . . It is a misreading of the situation to claim that it is only in the twentieth century that capitalism has become world-wide.  Immanuel Wallerstein The Capitalist World-Economy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1979) p. 19. The most complete reference on this point is Immanuel Wallerstein The Modern World System 3 vols. (New York: Academic Press 19741988). See also Giovanni Arrighi The Long Twentieth Century (London: Verso 1995). 14. See for example Samir Amin Empire of Chaos (New York: Monthly Review Press 1992). 15. For our analyses of the Roman Empire we have relied on some of the classic texts such as Gaetano de Sanctis Storia dei Romani 4 vols. (Turin: Bocca 19071923); Hermann Dessau Geschichte der romanischen Keiserzeit 2 vols. (Berlin: Weidmann 19241930); Michael Rostovzeff Social and Economic History of the Roman Empire 2 vols. (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1926); Pietro de Francisci Genesi e struttura del principato augusteo (Rome: Sampaolesi 1940); and Santo Mazzarino Fra Oriente ed Occidente (Florence: La Nuova Italia 1947). 16. See Johannes Adam Hartung Die Lehre von der Weltherrschaft im Mittelalter (Halle 1909); Heinrich Dannenbauer ed. Das Reich: Idee und Gestalt (Stuttgart: Cotta 1940); Georges de Lagarde La conception medieval de lordre en face de lumanisme de la Renaissance et de la Reforme in Congresso internazionale di studi umanistici Umanesimo e scienza politica (Milan: Marzorati 1951); and Santo Mazzarino The End of the Ancient World trans. George Holmes (New York: Knopf 1966). 17. See Michael Walzer Just and Unjust Wars 2nd ed. (New York: Basic Books 1992). The renewal of just war theory in the 1990s is demonstrated by the essays in Jean Bethke Elshtain ed. Just War Theory (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1992). 18. One should distinguish here between jus ad bellum (the right to make war) and jus in bello (law in war) or really the rules of the correct conduct of war. See Walzer Just and Unjust Wars pp. 6163 and 90. 19. On the Gulf War and justice see Norberto Bobbio Una guerra giusta? Sul conflitto del Golfo (Venice: Marsilio 1991); Ramsey Clark The Fire 418 NOT E S T O P AGES 1 4  1 7 This Time: U.S. War Crimes in the Gulf (New York: Thunders Mouth Press 1992); Jurgen Habermas The Past as Future trans. Max Pensky (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press 1994); and Jean Bethke Elshtain ed. But Was It Just? Reflections on the Morality of the Persian Gulf War (New York: Doubleday 1992). 20. For the influence of Niklas Luhmanns systematism on international juridical theory see the essays by Gunther Teubner in Gunther Teubner and Alberto Febbrajo eds. State Law and Economy as Autopoietic Systems (Milan: Giuffre` 1992). An adaptation of John Rawlss ethico-juridical theories was attempted by Charles R. Beitz in Political Theory and International Relations (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1979). 21. This concept was introduced and articulated in James Rosenau Governance Order and Change in World Politics in James Rosenau and Ernst-Otto Czempiel Governance without Government (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1992). 22. At one extreme see the set of essays assembled in V. Rittenberger ed. Beyond Anarchy: International Cooperation and Regimes (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1994). 23. See Hans Kelsen Peace through Law (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1944). 24. On Machiavellis reading of the Roman Empire see Antonio Negri Il potere costituente (Milan: Sugarco 1992) pp. 7596; in English Insurgencies: Constituent Power and the Modern State trans. Maurizia Boscagli (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1999). 25. For a reading of the juridical passage from modernity to postmodernity see Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1994) chaps. 6 and 7. 26. It is strange how in this internationalist debate almost the only work of Carl Schmitt that is taken up is Der Nomos der Erde im Volkerrecht des Jus Publicum Europaeum (Cologne: Greven 1950) when really precisely in this context his more important work is Verfassungslehre 8th ed. (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot 1993) and his positions developed around the definition of the concept of the political and the production of right. 27. In order to get a good idea of this process it may be enough to read together the disciplinary classics of international law and international economics linking their observations and prescriptions which emerge from different disciplinary formations but share a certain neorealism or really a realism in the Hobbesian sense. See for example Kenneth Neal Waltz Theory of International Politics (New York: Random House 1979); NOT E S T O P AGES 1 8  2 3 419 and Robert Gilpin The Political Economy of International Relations (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1987). 28. In order to get an initial idea of the vast and often confused literature on this topic see Gene Lyons and Michael Mastanduno eds. Beyond Westphalia? State Sovereignty and International Intervention (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1995); Arnold Kanter and Linton Brooks eds. U.S. Intervention Policy for the PostCold War World (New York: Norton 1994); Mario Bettati Le droit dingerence (Paris: Odile Jacob 1995); and Maurice Bernard La fin de lordre militaire (Paris: Presses de Sciences Politiques 1995). 29. On the ethics of international relations in addition to the propositions of Michael Walzer and Charles Beitz already cited see also Stanley Hoffmann Duties beyond Borders (Syracuse: Syracuse University Press 1981); and Terry Nardin and David R. Mapel eds. Traditions of International Ethics (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1992). 30. We are refering here to the two classic texts: Montesquieu Considerations on the Causes of the Greatness of the Romans and Their Decline trans. David Lowenthal (New York: Free Press 1965); and Edward Gibbon The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire 3 vols. (London: Penguin 1994). 31. As Jean Ehrard has amply shown the thesis that the decline of Rome began with Caesar was continually reproposed throughout the historiography of the age of Enlightenment. See Jean Ehrard La politique de Montesquieu (Paris: A. Colin 1965). 32. The principle of the corruption of political regimes was already implicit in the theory of the forms of government as it was formulated in the Sophistic period which was later codified by Plato and Aristotle. The principle of political corruption was later translated into a principle of historical development through theories that grasped the ethical schemes of the forms of government as cyclical temporal developments. Of all the proponents of different theoretical tendencies who have embarked on this endeavor (and the Stoics are certainly fundamental in this regard) Polybius is the one who really described the model in its definitive form celebrating the creative function of corruption. 1.2 BIOPOLITICAL PRODUCTION 1. The passage from disciplinary society to the society of control is not articulated explicitly by Foucault but remains implicit in his work. We follow the excellent commentaries of Gilles Deleuze in this interpretation. See Gilles Deleuze Foucault (Paris: Minuit 1986); and Post-scriptum 420 NOT E S T O P AGES 2 3  2 5 sur les societes de controle in Pourparlers (Paris: Minuit 1990). See also Michael Hardt The Withering of Civil Society Social Text no. 45 (Winter 1995) 2744. 2. See primarily Michel Foucault The History of Sexuality trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Vintage 1978) 1:135145. For other treatments of the concept of biopolitics in Foucualts opus see The Politics of Health in the Eighteenth Century in Power/Knowledge ed. Colin Gordon (New York: Pantheon 1980) pp. 166182; La naissance de la medecine sociale in Dits et ecrits (Paris: Gallimard 1994) 3:207228 particularly p. 210; and Naissance de la biopolitique in Dits et ecrits 3:818825. For examples of work by other authors following Foucaults notion of biopolitics see Hubert Dreyfus and Paul Rabinow eds. Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1992) pp. 133142; and Jacques Donzelot The Policing of Families trans. Robert Hurley (New York: Pantheon 1979). 3. Michel Foucault Les mailles du pouvoir in Dits et ecrits (Paris: Gallimard 1994) 4:182201; quotation p. 194. 4. Many thinkers have followed Foucault along these lines and successfully problematized the welfare state. See primarily Jacques Donzelot Linvention du social (Paris: Fayard 1984); and Francnois Ewald Letat providence (Paris: Seuil 1986). 5. See Karl Marx Results of the Immediate Process of Production trans. Rodney Livingstone published as the appendix to Capital trans. Ben Fowkes (New York: Vintage 1976) 1:9481084. See also Antonio Negri Marx beyond Marx trans. Harry Cleaver Michael Ryan and Maurizio Viano (New York: Autonomedia 1991). 6. See Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno The Dialectic of Enlightenment trans. John Cumming (New York: Herder and Herder 1972). 7. See Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari A Thousand Plateaus trans. Brian Massumi (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1987). 8. See for example Peter Dews Logics of Disintegration: Poststructuralist Thought and the Claims of Critical Theory (London: Verso 1987) chaps. 6 and 7. When one adopts this definition of power and the crises that traverse it Foucaults discourse (and even more so that of Deleuze and Guattari) presents a powerful theoretical framework for critiquing the welfare state. For analyses that are more or less in line with this discourse see Claus Offe Disorganized Capitalism: Contemporary Transformations of Work and Politics (Cambridge Mass.: MIT Press 1985); Antonio Negri Revolution Retrieved: Selected Writings (London: Red Notes 1988); and the essays by Antonio Negri included in Michael Hardt and Antonio NOT E S T O P AGES 2 6  2 8 421 Negri Labor of Dionysus (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1994) pp. 23213. 9. The notions of totalitarianism that were constructed during the period of the cold war proved to be useful instruments for propaganda but completely inadequate analytical tools leading most often to pernicious inquisitional methods and damaging moral arguments. The numerous shelves of our libraries that are filled with analyses of totalitarianism should today be regarded only with shame and could be thrown away with no hesitation. For a brief sample of the literature on totalitarianism from the most coherent to the most absurd see Hannah Arendt The Origins of Totalitarianism (New York: Harcourt Brace 1951); and Jeanne Kirkpatrick Dictatorships and Double Standards (New York: Simon and Schuster 1982). We will return to the concept of totalitarianism in more detail in Section 2.2. 10. We are referring here to the thematics of Mobilmachtung that were developed in the Germanic world primarily in the 1920s and 1930s more or less from Ernst Junger to Carl Schmitt. In French culture too such positions emerged in the 1930s and the polemics around them have still not died down. The figure of Georges Bataille is at the center of this discussion. Along different lines on general mobilization as a paradigm of the constitution of collective labor power in Fordist capitalism see Jean Paul de Gaudemar La mobilisation generale (Paris: Maspero 1978). 11. One could trace a very interesting line of discussions that effectively develop the Foucauldian interpretation of biopower from Jacques Derridas reading of Walter Benjamins Critique of Violence (Force of Law in Drucilla Cornell Michel Rosenfeld and David Gray Carlson eds. Deconstruction and the Possibility of Justice [New York: Routledge 1992] pp. 367) to Giorgio Agambens more recent and more stimulating contribution Homo sacer: il potere sovrano e la nuda vita (Turin: Einaudi 1995). It seems fundamental to us however that all of these discussions be brought back to the question of the productive dimensions of bios identifying in other words the materialist dimension of the concept beyond any conception that is purely naturalistic (life as zoe`) or simply anthropological (as Agamben in particular has a tendency to do making the concept in effect indifferent). 12. Michel Foucault La naissance de la medecine sociale in Dits et ecrits (Paris: Gallimard 1994) 3:210. 13. See Henri Lefebvre Lideologie structuraliste (Paris: Anthropos 1971); Gilles Deleuze A quoi reconnait-on le structuralisme? in Francnois Chatelet ed. Histoire de la philosophie vol. 8 (Paris: Hachette 1972) pp. 299335; 422 NOT E S T O P AGES 2 8  3 0 and Fredric Jameson The Prison-House of Language (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1972). 14. When Deleuze formulates his methodological differences with Foucault in a private letter written in 1977 the primary point of disagreement comes down precisely to just such a question of production. Deleuze prefers the term desire to Foucaults pleasure he explains because desire grasps the real and active dynamic of the production of social reality whereas pleasure is merely inert and reactive: Pleasure interrupts the positivity of desire and the constitution of its plane of immanence. See Gilles Deleuze Desir et plaisir Magazine Litteraire no. 325 (October 1994) 5965; quotation p. 64. 15. Felix Guattari has perhaps developed the extreme consequences of this type of social critique while carefully avoiding falling into the antigrand narrative style of postmodernist argument in his Chaosmosis trans. Paul Bains and Julian Pefanis (Sydney: Power Publications 1995). From a metaphysical point of view among the followers of Nietzsche we find roughly analogous positions expressed in Massimo Cacciari DRAN: meridiens de la decision dans la pensee contemporaine (Paris: LE clat 1991). 16. In English see primarily the essays in Paolo Virno and Michael Hardt eds. Radical Thought in Italy (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1996). See also Christian Marazzi Il posto dei calzini: la svolta linguistica delleconomia e i suoi effetti nella politica (Bellinzona: Edizioni Casagrande); and numerous issues of the French journal Futur anterieur particularly nos. 10 (1992) and 3536 (1996). For an analysis that appropriates central elements of this project but ultimately fails to capture its power see Andre Gorz Mise`re du present richesse du possible (Paris: Galilee 1997). 17. The framework on which this line of inquiry is built is both its great wealth and its real limitation. The analysis must in effect be carried beyond the constraints of the workerist (operaista) analysis of capitalist development and the state-form. One of its limitations for example is highlighted by Gayatri Spivak In Other Worlds: Essays in Cultural Politics (New York: Routledge 1988) p. 162 who insists on the fact that the conception of value in this line of Marxist analysis may function in the dominant countries (including in the context of certain streams of feminist theory) but completely misses the mark in the context of the subordinated regions of the globe. Spivaks questioning is certainly extremely important for the problematic we are developing in this study. In fact from a methodological point of view we would say that the most profound and solid problematic complex that has yet been elaborated for the critique of biopolitics is found in feminist theory particularly Marxist and socialist NOT E S T O P AGES 3 0  3 2 423 feminist theories that focus on womens work affective labor and the production of biopower. This presents the framework perhaps best suited to renew the methodology of the European workerist schools. 18. The theories of the turbulence of the international order and even more of the new world order which we cited earlier (see primarily the work of J. G. Ruggie) generally avoid in their explanation of the causes of this turbulence any reference to the contradictory character of capitalist relations. Social turbulence is considered merely a consequence of the international dynamics among state actors in such a way that turbulence can be normalized within the strict disciplinary limits of international relations. Social and class struggles are effectively hidden by the method of analysis itself. From this perspective then the productive bios cannot really be understood. The same is more or less the case for the authors of the world-systems perspective who focus primarily on the cycles of the system and systemic crises (see the works of Wallerstein and Arrighi cited earlier). Theirs is in effect a world (and a history) without subjectivity. What they miss is the function of the productive bios or really the fact that capital is not a thing but a social relationship an antagonistic relationship one side of which is animated by the productive life of the multitude. 19. Giovanni Arrighi The Long Twentieth Century (London: Verso 1995) for example claims such a continuity in the role of capitalist corporations. For an excellent contrasting view in terms of periodization and methodological approach see Luciano Ferrari Bravo Introduzione: vecchie e nuove questioni nella teoria dellimperialismo in Luciano Ferrari Bravo ed. Imperialismo e classe operaia multinazionale (Milan: Feltrinelli 1975) pp. 770. 20. See from the perspective of political analysis Paul Kennedy Preparing for the Twenty-first Century (New York: Random House 1993); and from the perspective of economic topography and socialist critique David Harvey The Condition of Postmodernity (Oxford: Blackwell 1989). 21. Marx Capital 1:742. 22. On this point the bibliography we could cite is seemingly endless. In effect theories of advertising and consumption have been integrated (just in time) into the theories of production to the point where we now have ideologies of attention posed as economic value! In any case for a selection of the numerous works that touch on this field one would do well to see Susan Strasser Satisfaction Guaranteed: The Making of the American Mass Market (New York: Pantheon 1989); Gary Cross Time and Money: The Making of Consumer Culture (New York: Routledge 424 NOT E S T O P AGES 3 2  3 4 1993); and for a more interesting analysis from another perspective The Project on Disney Inside the Mouse (Durham: Duke University Press 1995). The production of the producer however is not only the production of the consumer. It also involves the production of hierarchies mechanisms of inclusion and exclusion and so forth. It involves finally the production of crises. From this point of view see Jeremy Rifkin The End of Work: The Decline of Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Postmarket Era (New York: Putnam 1995); and Stanley Aronowitz and William DiFazio The Jobless Future (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1994). 23. We are indebted to Deleuze and Guattari and their A Thousand Plateaus for the most fully elaborated phenomenological description of this industrialmonetary-world-nature which constitutes the first level of the world order. 24. See Edward Comor ed. The Global Political Economy of Communication (London: Macmillan 1994). 25. See Stephen Bradley ed. Globalization Technologies and Competition: The Fusion of Computers and Telecommunications in the 90s (Cambridge Mass.: Harvard Business School Press 1993); and Simon Serfaty The Media and Foreign Policy (London: Macmillan 1990). 26. See Jurgen Habermas Theory of Communicative Action trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston: Beacon Press 1984). We discuss this relationship between communication and production in more detail in Section 3.4. 27. See Hardt and Negri Labor of Dionysus chaps. 6 and 7. 28. Despite the extremism of the authors presented in Martin Albrow and Elizabeth King eds. Globalization Knowledge and Society (London: Sage 1990) and the relative moderation of Bryan S. Turner Theories of Modernity and Postmodernity (London: Sage 1990) and Mike Featherstone ed. Global Culture Nationalism Globalization and Modernity (London: Sage 1991) the differences among their various positions are really relatively minor. We should always keep in mind that the image of a global civil society is born not only in the minds of certain postmodernist philosophers and among certain followers of Habermas (such as Jean Cohen and Andrew Arato) but also and more importantly in the Lockean tradition of international relations. This latter group includes such important theorists as Richard Falk David Held Anthony Giddens and (in certain respects) Danilo Zolo. On the concept of civil society in the global context see Michael Walzer ed. Toward a Global Civil Society (Providence: Berghahn Books 1995). 29. With the iconoclastic irony of Jean Baudrillards more recent writings such as The Gulf War Did Not Take Place trans. Paul Patton (Bloomington: NOT E S T O P AGES 3 5  3 8 425 Indiana University Press 1995) a certain vein of French postmodernism has gone back to a properly surrealist framework. 30. There is an uninterrupted continuity from the late cold war notions of democracy enforcing and democratic transition to the imperial theories of peace enforcing. We have already highlighted the fact that many moral philosophers supported the Gulf War as a just cause whereas juridical theorists following the important lead of Richard Falk were generally opposed. See for example Richard Falk Twisting the U.N. Charter to U.S. Ends in Hamid Mowlana George Gerbner and Herbert Schiller eds. Triumph of the Image: The Medias War in the Persian Gulf (Boulder: Westview Press 1992) pp. 175190. See also the discussion of the Gulf War in Danilo Zolo Cosmopolis: Prospects for World Government trans. David McKie (Cambridge: Polity Press 1997). 31. For a representative example see Richard Falk Positive Prescriptions for the Future World Order Studies Program occasional paper no. 20 (Princeton: Center for International Studies 1991). To see how NGOs are integrated into this more or less Lockean framework of global constitutionalism one should refer to the public declarations of Antonio Cassese president of the United Nations Criminal Court in Amsterdam in addition to his books International Law in a Divided World (Oxford: Clarendon Press 1986) and Human Rights in a Changing World (Philadelphia: Temple University Press 1990). 32. Even the proposals to reform the United Nations proceed more or less along these lines. For a good bibliography of such works see Joseph Preston Baratta Strengthening the United Nations: A Bibliography on U.N. Reform and World Federalism (New York: Greenwood 1987). 33. This is the line that is promoted in some of the strategic documents published by the U.S. military agencies. According to the present Pentagon doctrine the project of the enlargement of market democracy should be supported by both adequate microstrategies that are based on (both pragmatic and systemic) zones of application and the continual identification of critical points and fissures in the antagonistic strong cultural blocs that would lead toward their dissolution. In this regard see the work of Maurice Rounai of the Strategic Institute in Paris. See also the works on U.S. interventionism cited in Section 1.1 note 28. 34. One should refer once again to the work of Richard Falk and Antonio Cassese. We should emphasize in particular how a weak conception of the exercise of judicial functions by the U.N. Court of Justice has gradually often under the influence of Left political forces been transformed into a strong conception. In other words there is a passage 426 NOT E S T O P AGES 4 1  4 7 from the demand that the Court of Justice be invested with the functions of judicial sanction that come under the authority of the U.N. structure to the demand that the court play a direct and active role in the decisions of the U.N. and its organs regarding norms of parity and material justice among states to the point of carrying out direct intervention in the name of human rights. 35. See Max Weber Economy and Society trans. Guenther Roth and Claus Wittich (Berkeley: University of California Press 1968) vol. 1 chap. 3 sec. 2 The Three Pure Types of Authority pp. 215216. 1.3 ALTERNATIVES WITHIN EMPIRE 1. We mean to flirt with Hegel here the way Marx described in the famous postscript to volume 1 of Capital (trans. Ben Fowkes [New York: Vintage 1976]) of January 24 1873 (pp. 102103). As they did to Marx Hegels terms seem useful to us to frame the argument but quickly we will run up against the real limit of their utility. 2. This presentation is admittedly simplified and many studies present much more sophisticated discussions of place. It seems to us however that these political analyses always come back to a notion of defending or preserving the bounded local identity or territory. Doreen Massey argues explicitly for a politics of place in which place is conceived not as bounded but as open and porous to flows beyond in Space Place and Gender (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1994) in particular p. 5. We would contend however that a notion of place that has no boundaries empties the concept completely of its content. For an excellent review of the literature and an alternative conception of place see Arif Dirlik Place-based Imagination: Globalism and the Politics of Place unpublished manuscript. 3. We will return to the concept of the nation at greater length in Section 2.2. 4. I view location as a fundamental material attribute of human activity but recognize that location is socially produced. David Harvey The Limits of Capital (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1984) p. 374. Arjun Appadurai also discusses the production of locality in a way consistent with Harvey and with our argument in Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1996) pp. 178199. 5. Erich Auerbach Mimesis: The Representation of Reality in Western Literature trans. Willard Trask (Princeton: Princeton University Press 1953). 6. This methodological connection between critique and construction that rests firmly on the basis of a collective subject was articulated well in NOT E S T O P AGES 4 8  5 2 427 Marxs own historical writings and developed by various traditions of heterodox Marxist historiography in the twentieth century such as the work of E. P. Thompson the Italian workerist writers and the South Asian subaltern historians. 7. See for example Guy Debords Society of the Spectacle trans. Donald Nicholson-Smith (New York: Zone Books 1994) which is perhaps the best articulation in its own delirious way of the contemporary consciousness of the triumph of capital. 8. For a good example of this deconstructionist method that demonstrates its virtues and its limitations see the work of Gayatri Spivak in particular her introduction to Ranajit Guha and Gayatri Spivak eds. Selected Subaltern Studies (New York: Oxford University Press 1988) pp. 332. 9. See Arif Dirlik Mao Zedong and Chinese Marxism  in Saree Makdisi Cesare Casarino and Rebecca Karl eds.

Critical Perspectives on Mao Zedongs Thought (Atlantic Heights N.J.: Humanities Press 1997) pp. 5983. 10. On the tactical ambiguities of the national politics of the socialist and communist parties see primarily the work of the Austro-Marxists such as Otto Bauers Die Nationalitatenfrage und die Sozialdomocratie (Vienna: Wiener Volksbuchhandlung 1924); and Stalins influential Marxism and the National Question in Marxism and the National and Colonial Question (New York: International Publishers 1935) pp. 361.

On the hypothesis that struggles precede and prefigure capitalist development and restructuring see Antonio Negri Revolution Retrieved (London: Red Notes 1988). 13. This notion of the proletariat might thus be understood in Marxs own terms as the personification of a strictly economic category that is the subject of labor under capital. As we redefine the very concept of labor and extend the range of activities understood under it (as we have done elsewhere and will continue to do in this book) the traditional distinction 428 NOT E S T O P AGES 5 5  6 0 between the economic and the cultural breaks down. Even in Marxs most economistic formulations however proletariat must be understood really as a properly political category.

In opposition to the theories of the weakest link which not only were the heart of the tactics of the Third International but also were largely adopted by the anti-imperialist tradition as a whole the Italian operaismo movement of the 1960s and 1970s proposed a theory of the strongest link. For the fundamental theoretical thesis see Mario Tronti Operai e capitale (Turin: Einaudi 1966) esp. pp. 8995. 20. One can find ample and continuous documentation of these techniques of disinformation and silencing in publications ranging from Le Monde Diplomatique to Z Magazine and the Covert Action Bulletin. Noam Chomsky has tirelessly worked to unveil and counter such disinformation in his numerous books and lectures. See for example Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of Mass Media (New York: Pantheon 1988). The Gulf War presented an excellent example of the imperial management of communication. See W. Lance Bennett and David L. Paletz eds. Taken by Storm: The Media Public Opinion and U.S. Foreign Policy in the Gulf War (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1994); and Douglas Kellner The Persian Gulf TV War (Boulder: Westview Press 1992). 21. This operation of flattening the struggles in the form of an inverted homology with the system is adequately represented by the (in other NOT E S T O P AGES 6 1  7 3 429 respects quite impressive and important) work of Immanuel Wallerstein and the world systems school. See for example Giovanni Arrighi Terence Hopkins and Immanuel Wallerstein Antisystemic Movements (London: Verso 1989). 22.

Michael Hardt (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1991). 12. The various nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophical frameworks of negative thought from Nietzsche to Heidegger and Adorno are fundamentally right to foresee the end of modern metaphysics and to link modernity and crisis. What these authors generally do not recognize however is that there are two modernities at play here and that the crisis is a direct result of their conflict. For this reason they are unable to see the alternatives within modernity that extend beyond the limits of modern metaphysics.

Lenin was highly critical of Luxemburgs position primarily because she failed to recognize the progressive character of the nationalism (even the bourgeois nationalism) of subordinated countries. Lenin thus affirms the right to national self-determination which is really the right to secession for all. See V. I.

See Roberto Zapperis Introduction ibid. pp. 7117. 23. Well over one hundred years later Antonio Gramscis notion of the national-popular was conceived as part of an effort to recuperate precisely this hegemonic class operation in the service of the proletariat. For Gramsci national-popular is the rubric under which intellectuals would be united with the people and thus it is a powerful resource for the construction of a popular hegemony. See Antonio Gramsci Quaderni del carcere (Turin: Einaudi 1977) 3:211320. For an excellent critique of Gramscis notion of the national-popular see Alberto Asor Rosa Scrittori e popolo 7th ed.

We should note that the various liberal interpretations of Hegel from Rudolf Haym to Franz Rosenzweig only succeeded in recuperating his political thought by focusing on its national aspects. See Rudolf Haym Hegel und sein Zeit (Berlin 1857); Franz Rosenzweig Hegel und der Staat (Munich 1920); and Eric Weil Hegel et lEtat (Paris: Vrin 1950). Rosenzweig is the one who best understands the tragedy of the unavoidable connection between the nation and ethicality in Hegels thought. See Franz Rosenzweig The Star of Redemption trans. Willaim Hallo (New York: Holt Rinehart and Winston 1971); and the excellent interpretation of it Stephane Moses Syste`me et revelation: la philosophie de Franz Rosenzweig (Paris: Seuil 1982). 26. [Socialists] must therefore unequivocally demand that the SocialDemocrats of the oppressing countries (of the so-called great nations in particular) should recognize and defend the right of the oppressed nations to self-determination in the political sense of the word i.e. the right to political separation.

The question of black sovereignty is precisely the issue at stake in Cedric Robinsons critique of W. E. B. Du Boiss support for Liberia in the 1920s and 1930s.

Benedict Anderson maintains that philosophers have unjustly disdained the concept of nation and that we should view it in a more neutral light. Part of the difficulty is that one tends unconsciously to hypostatize the existence of Nationalism-with-a-big-N (rather as one might Age-witha-capital-A) and then classify it as an ideology. (Note that if everyone has an age Age is merely an analytical expression.) It would I think make things easier if one treated it as if it belonged with kinship and religion rather than with liberalism or fascism.  Anderson Imagined Communities p. 5. Everyone belongs to a nation as everyone belongs to (or has) an age a race a gender and so forth. The danger here is that Anderson naturalizes the nation and our belonging to it. We must on the contrary denaturalize the nation and recognize its historical construction and political effects. 32.

In fact negritude appears like the upbeat [le temps faible] of a dialectical progression: the theoretical and practical affirmation of white supremacy is the thesis; the position of negritude as an antithetical value is the moment of negativity.

We should remember that within the sphere of communist and socialist movements the discourse of nationalism not only legitimated the struggle for liberation from colonial powers but also served as a means of insisting on the autonomy and differences of local revolutionary experiences from the models of dominant socialist powers. For example Chinese nationalism was the banner under which Chinese revolutionaries could resist Soviet control and Soviet models translating Marxism into the language of the Chinese peasantry (that is into Mao Zedong thought). Similarly in the subsequent period revolutionaries from Vietnam to Cuba and Nicaragua insisted on the national nature of struggles in order to assert their autonomy from Moscow and Beijing. 35.

What is necessary for a postmodernist critique is first to identify what modernist means in the field and then to pose a successor paradigm that is in some way consistent with some form of postmodernist thinking. Consider for example a field that might at first sight seem an unlikely candidate for such an operation: public administration that is the study of bureaucracies. The modernist paradigm of research that dominates the field is defined by a prescription of neutral public administration ascribed to Wilson (separation of politics from administration) Taylor (scientific management) and Weber (hierarchical command).

Scholars who are convinced that this paradigm is outdated and leads to undemocratic governmental practice can use postmodernist thinking as a weapon to transform the field. In this case they propose non-foundational discourse theory as a postmodernist model that will create more active public interactions and thus democratize bureaucracy (p. 75). 7.

William Chafe poses 1968 as a shift of regime in the United States from the perspective of a social historian: Any historian who uses the word watershed to describe a given moment runs the risk of oversimplifying the complexity of the historical process. However if the word is employed to signify a turning point that marks the end to domination by one constellation of forces and the beginning of domination by another it seems appropriate as a description of what took place in America in 1968. William Chafe The Unfinished Journey: America since World War II (Oxford: Oxford University Press 1986) p. 378.

There are undoubtedly zones of deprivation within the world market where the flow of capital and goods is reduced to a minimum. In some cases this deprivation is determined by an explicit political decision (as in the trade sanctions against Iraq) and in other cases it follows from the NOT E S T O P AGES 1 9 0  1 9 9 445 implicit logics of global capital (as in the cycles of poverty and starvation in sub-Saharan Africa). In all cases however these zones do not constitute an outside to the capitalist market; rather they function within the world market as the most subordinated rungs of the global economic hierarchy. 13.

Yann Moulier Boutang argues that the Marxian concept of the industrial reserve army has proven to be a particularly strong obstacle to our understanding the power of this mobility. In this framework the divisions and stratifications of the labor force in general are understood as predetermined and fixed by the quantitative logic of development that is by the productive rationalities of capitalist rule. This rigid and univocal command is seen as having such power that all forms of labor power are considered as being purely and exclusively determined by capital. Even unemployed populations and migrating populations are seen as springing from and determined by capital as a reserve army. Labor power is deprived of subjectivity and difference since it is considered completely subject to the iron laws of capital.

Control and mutation are perhaps the defining themes of cyberpunk fiction. It is sufficient to see the seminal text William Gibson Neuromancer (New York: Ace 1984).

On Burroughs and Cronenberg see Steve Shaviro Doom Patrols: A Theoretical Fiction about Postmodernism (London: Serpents Tail 1997) pp. 101121. 15.

David Fernbach (London: Penguin 1981) pp. 349375. 3. The following argument raises the specter of underconsumptionist theories which argue that the inability to consume all the commodities produced is capitalisms fatal flaw and will necessarily lead to collapse. Many Marxist and non-Marxist economists have convincingly argued against any idea that the capitalist tendency to produce too much or consume too little will be catastrophic. For an evaluation of underconsumptionist arguments in Marx and Luxemburg see Michael Bleaney Under-consumption Theories (New York: International Publishers 1976) pp. 102119 and 186201; and Ernest Mandel Introduction to Karl Marx Capital vol. 2 trans.

Rudolf Wichmann (London: Allen Lane 1972) pp. 151270. We should point out that economic necessity based on quantitative calculations is sometimes the form but never the substance of Marxs or Luxemburgs arguments. Any necessity is really historical and social. What Marx and Luxemburg identified was an economic barrier that helps explain how capital has historically been driven or induced to expand to move outside itself and incorporate new markets within its realm. 4. For Marxs analysis of the abstinence theory of capitalist consumption see Capital vol. 1 trans. Ben Fowkes (New York: Vintage 1976) pp. 738746 and Capital 3:366. 5. The total mass of commodities the total product must be sold both that portion which replaces constant and variable capital and that which represents surplus-value. If this does not happen or happens only partly or only at prices that are less than the price of production then although the worker is certainly exploited his exploitation is not realized as such for the capitalist and may even not involve any realization of the surplus value extracted.

We should note here that although Lenin is certainly correct in claiming that Kautskys position is a deviation from Marxs method when he ignores the potential conflicts and practical opportunities of the present situation Kautskys reading of the tendency toward a unified world market does indeed find resonance in Marxs work particularly in his articles on colonialism in India where he posed a linear tendency of imperialist development toward the formation of a world market.

It is particularly important to give credit where credit is due today when we seem to be confronted with numerous versions of historical revisionism. Poor Gramsci communist and militant before all else tortured and killed by fascism and ultimately by the bosses who financed fascism poor Gramsci was given the gift of being considered the founder of a strange notion of hegemony that leaves no place for a Marxian politics. (See for example Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe Hegemony and Socialist Strategy: Towards a Radical Democratic Politics [London: Verso 1985] especially pp. 6571.)

I occasionally get just as tired of the slogan postmodern as anyone else but when I am tempted to regret my complicity with it to deplore its misuses and its notoriety and to conclude with some reluctance that it raises more problems than it solves I find myself pausing to wonder whether any other concept can dramatize the issues in quite so effective and economical a fashion.

On the economic crisis of 1929 see also the classic analysis of John Kenneth Galbraith The Great Crash 1929 (Boston: Houghton Mifflin 1954) which focuses on speculation as the cause of the crisis; and more recently Gerard Dumenil and D.

More generally on the theoretical problems that the 1929 crisis bequeathed to twentieth-century political economy see Michel Aglietta A Theory of Capitalist Regulation trans. David Fernbach (London: New Left Books 1979); and Robert Boyer and Jacques Mistral Accumulation inflation crises (Paris: PUF 1978). 2. John Maynard Keynes was perhaps the person with the clearest foresight at the Versailles Conference. Already at the conference and then later in his essay The Economic Consequences of Peace he denounced the political egotism of the victors which would become one of the contributing factors to the economic crisis of the 1920s. 3. This type of interpretation of the economic and political crisis of 1929 should be contrasted very strongly to revisionist historiographical con- NOT E S T O P AGES 2 4 1  2 4 3 453 ceptions in the style of Francnois Furet Ernst Nolte and Renzo De Felice. It demonstrates the great importance of the economic element in the definition of the political choices of the twentieth century. The revisionist histories on the contrary read the developments of the century as a linear progression of ideas that are often posed in dialectical opposition with fascism and communism occupying the defining poles. See for example Francnois Furet Le passe dune illusion: essai sur lidee communiste au XXe sie`cle (Paris: Robert Laffont 1995) especially the chapter in which he discusses the relationship between communism and fascism (pp. 189248). 4. See Jon Halliday A Political History of Japanese Capitalism (New York: Pantheon 1975) pp. 82133. 5. It is above all the liberal historiography of authors such as Arthur Meier Schlesinger that has insisted on the synthetic characteristics of American progressivism.

The notion of discipline developed by Michel Foucault certainly has a different focus from the one we employ here but we are refering to the same practices and the same globality of application. Foucaults primary theoretical concerns are that discipline is deployed through institutional architectures that the power of discipline is located not in some central source but in the capillary formations at its point of exercise and that the subjectivities are produced by internalizing discipline and enacting its practices. This is all equally valid for our consideration here. Our primary focus however is on how the practices and relationships of disciplinarity that originated in the factory regime came to invest the entire social terrain as a mechanism of both production and government that is as a regime of social production. 454 NOT E S T O P AGES 2 4 3  2 4 6 8. The fundamental text that describes this development and anticipates its results is Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno Dialectic of Enlightenment trans. John Cumming (New York: Herder and Herder 1972) which was written in the mid-1940s. Numerous other works followed in the description of disciplinary society and its implacable development as a biopolitical society works coming out of different cultural and intellectual traditions but completely coherent in defining the tendency.

In ecological thought too at least in its most productive paradigms we can see clearly that the nature in question is equally human and nonhuman; ecology involves not just the preservation of things but the production of relationships and the production of subjectivity as well. See Felix Guattari Les trois ecologies (Paris: Galilee 1989); and Verena Andermatt Conley Ecopolitics: The Environment in Poststructuralist Thought (London: Routledge 1997). Franco Piperno continues this ecological line of thought albeit in a different register in Elogio dello spirito pubblico meridionale (Rome: Manifestolibri 1997). 18. In her effort to think the importance and real limits of the outside Rosa Luxemburg may have been the first great ecological thinker of the twentieth century. The best examples of Marxist ecological thought in authors such as Andre Gorz and James OConnor adopt a form of argument similar to Luxemburgs anti-imperialist position (although their work does not derive directly from hers): capitalist production necessarily implies an expansion into and destruction of nature which not only has tragic consequences for life on the planet but also undermines the future viability of capitalism itself.

We do not mean to suggest that capital can perpetually through technological advances reconcile its destructive relationship with its (human and nonhuman) environment. What technological advance can do is shift the terrain of conflict and defer the crisis but limits and antagonisms remain. 22.

Marx argued that the greater concentration and centralization of capital acted against the forces of competition and was thus a destructive process for capital. See Karl Marx Capital vol. 3 trans. David Fernbach (London: Penguin 1981) pp. 566573. Lenin took up this same argument in his analysis of the monopoly phase of capital: monopolies destroy competition which is the foundation of capitalist development. See V. I. Lenin Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism (New York: International Publishers 1939) pp. 1630. 5. See for example Richard Barnet and John Cavanagh Global Dreams: Imperial Corporations and the New World Order (New York: Simon and Schuster 1994). 6. The concept of the autonomy of the political which belongs to the tradition of political theology was given its first great definition by the political theologian Thomas Hobbes. The concept was raised to even greater heights by Carl Schmitt; see principally The Concept of the Political trans. George Schwab (New Brunswick N.J.: Rutgers University Press 1976); and Verfassungslehre 8th ed. (Berlin: Duncker & Humblot 1993). The political is understood here as the foundation of every social relation- 464 NOT E S T O P AGE 3 1 2 ship and the originary evaluation or decision that constructs the sphere of power and thus guarantees the space of life. It is interesting to note that Schmitts conception of the political is ineluctably tied to the juridical definition of the nation-state and inconceivable outside of its realm. Schmitt himself seems to recognize this fact after having witnessed the catastrophe of the German nation-state. See Carl Schmitt Der Nomos der Erde im Volkerrecht des jus publicum europaeum (Cologne: Greven Verlag 1950). The most extensive consideration of Schmitts conception of the political that we know is contained in Carlo Galli Genealogia della politica: C. Schmitt e la crisi del pensiero politico moderno (Bologna: Il Mulino 1996). This critique of Scmitts concept of the autonomy of the political should also be applied to the various positions that in some way derive from his thought. At two extremes we can cite Leo Strauss who tried to appropriate Schmitts concept under his own liberal conception of natural right and Mario Tronti who sought to find in the autonomy of the political a terrain that could support a compromise with liberal political forces in a period when the Western European communist parties were in deep crisis. For Strausss interpretation of Schmitts text and their ambiguous relationship see Heinrich Meier Carl Schmitt and Leo Strauss: The Hidden Dialogue trans. J. Harvey Lomax (Chicago: University of Chicago Press 1995). For Tronti see Lautonomia del politico (Milan: Feltrinelli 1977). 7. There are numerous excellent critiques of the media and their purported objectivity. For two good examples see Edward Said Covering Islam: How the Media and the Experts Determine How We See the Rest of the World (New York: Pantheon 1981); and Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of Mass Media (New York: Pantheon 1988). 8.

It is interesting to note here that at least since the constitutionalism of the Weimar Republic the continental European tradition of constitutional thought has also adopted these principles which were presumed to belong only to the Anglo-Saxon world. The fundamental texts for the German tradition in this regard are Max Weber Parlament und Regierung im neugeordneten Deutschland (Munich: Duncker & Humblot 1918); Hugo Preuss Staat Recht und Freiheit (Tubingen: Mohr 1926); and Hermann Heller Die Souveranitat (Berlin: W. de Gruyter 1927). 15. Generally the analyses that come from the Left are the ones that insist most strongly that the genesis of Empire activates the bad forms of government. See for example Etienne Balibar La crainte des masses (Paris: Galilee 1997) a book which in other regards is extremely open to the analysis of the new processes of the (mass) production of subjectivity. 16. For an analysis of these processes and a good discussion of the relevant bibliography see Yann Moulier Boutang La revanche des externalites: globalisation des economies externalites mobilite transformation de leconomie et de lintervention publique Futur anterieur no. 3940 (Fall 1997) pp. 85115. 17. It should be clear from what we have said thus far that the theoretical condition underlying our hypotheses has to involve a radically revised analysis of reproduction. In other words any theoretical conception that regards reproduction as simply part of the circulation of capital (as classical economics Marxian theory and neoclassical theories have done) cannot deal critically with the conditions of our new situation particularly those resulting from the political-economic relations of the world market in postmodernity. Our description of biopower in Section 1.2 is the beginning of such a revised analysis of reproduction. For the definition of some fundamental elements that relate to the integration of labor affect and biopower see Antonio Negri Value and Affect and Michael Hardt Affective Labor boundary2 26 no. 2 (Summer 1999). 466 NOT E S T O P AGES 3 1 9  3 2 7 18. We are refering once again to the work of Michel Foucault and to Gilles Deleuzes interpretation of it. See our discussion in Section 1.2. 19. This first variable and the analysis of the functioning of the network in constitutional terms relates in certain respects to the various autopoietic theories of networks. See for example the work of Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela. For an excellent analysis of systems theory in the context of postmodern theories see Cary Wolfe Critical Environments (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1998). 20. The various advances in systems theories contribute also to our understanding of this second variable. Niklas Luhmanns work has been the most influential for the analysis of autopoietic systems in terms of legal and social philosophy. 21. Jameson offers an excellent critique of the conception of mass culture as sheer manipulation. He argues that although mass culture is managed it nonetheless contains utopian possibilities.

There is of course one element of transcendence and segmentation that is essential to the functioning of capital and that is class exploitation. This is a boundary however flexible or indiscernible it may be at times that capital must maintain throughout society. Class divisions continue NOT E S T O P AGES 3 2 8  3 5 4 467 to be centrally effective in the new segmentations that we investigate later in this section. 5.

The measure of value means its orderly exploitation the norm of its social division and its capitalist reproduction. Certainly Marx goes beyond Marx and one should never pretend that his discussions of labor and value are only a discourse on measure: beyond value labor is always the living power of being. See Antonio Negri Twenty Theses on Marx in Saree Makdisi Cesare Casarino and Rebecca Karl eds. Marxism Beyond Marxism (New York: Routledge 1996) pp. 149180. 7. Aristotle Nicomachean Ethics trans.

Hugh Tomlinson and Graham Burchell (New York: Columbia University Press 1994); and Gilles Deleuze Bergsonism trans. Hugh Tomlinson and Barbara Habberjam (New York: Zone 1988) pp. 94 103. Our conception of virtuality and its relationship to reality is somewhat different from the one that Deleuze derives from Bergson which distinguishes between the passage from the virtual to the actual and that from the possible to the real. Bergsons primary concern in this distinction and in his affirmation of the virtual-actual couple over the possible-real is to emphasize the creative force of being and highlight that being is not merely the reduction of numerous possible worlds to a single real world based on resemblance but rather that being is always an act of creation and unforeseeable novelty. See Henri Bergson The Possible and the Real in The Creative Mind trans. Mabelle Andison (New York: Philosophical Library 1946) pp. 91106. We certainly do recognize the need to insist on the creative powers of virtuality but this Bergsonian discourse is insufficient for us insofar as we also need to insist on the reality of the being created its ontological weight and the institutions that structure the world creating necessity out of contingency. On the passage from the virtual to the real see Gilbert Simondon Lindividu et sa gene`se physicobiologique (Paris: PUF 1964); and Brian Massumi The Autonomy of Affect Cultural Critique no. 31 (Fall 1995) 83109. 9. Marxs discussions of abstraction have a double relation to this discourse of virtuality and possibility. One might do well in fact to distinguish between two Marxian notions of abstraction. On the one hand and on the side of capital abstraction means separation from our powers to act and thus it is a negation of the virtual. On the other hand however and on the side of labor the abstract is the general set of our powers to act NOT E S T O P AGES 3 5 8  3 6 7 469 the virtual itself.

On the priority of resistance to power see Gilles Deleuze Foucault trans. Sean Hand (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1988) p. 89: The final word on power is that resistance comes first. 14. This dialectic of obstacle and limit with respect to the power of the mind on the one hand and political power on the other was well understood by that current of the phenomenology of subjectivity that (in contrast to the Heideggerian current) recognized Nazism and thus the capitalist state as the true limit of historical progress. From Husserl to Sartre we find the central effort to transform limit into threshold and in many ways Foucault takes up this same line. See Edmund Husserl Crisis of European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology trans. David Carr (Evanston Ill.: Northwestern University Press 1970); Jean-Paul Sartre Critique of Dialectical Reason trans. Quentin Hoare (London: Verso 1990); and Deleuze Foucault. 15.

Robert Hurley Mark Lane and Helen Lane (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press 1983). 22. Karl Marx Capital vol. 1 trans. Ben Fowkes (New York: Vintage 1976) pp. 554555. 23. Obviously when we speak about a materialist telos we are speaking about a telos that is constructed by subjects constituted by the multitude in action. This involves a materialist reading of history which recognizes that the institutions of society are formed through the encounter and conflict of social forces themselves. The telos in this case in not predetermined but constructed in the process. Materialist historians such as Thucydides and Machiavelli like the great materialist philosophers such as Epicurus Lucretius and Spinoza have never negated a telos constructed by human actions. As Marx wrote in the introduction to the Grundrisse it is not the anatomy of the ape that explains that of humans but vice versa the anatomy of humans that explains that of the ape (p. 105). The telos appears only afterwards as a result of the actions of history. 4.2 GENERATION AND CORRUPTION 1.
